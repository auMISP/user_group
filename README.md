# Australian MISP User Group

The primary aim of this group is for Australian [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org) enthusiasts to meet and share information on CTI and the various ways they have been using MISP to exploit their MISP data to gain meaningful and relevant threat intelligence.  So, whether you are a seasoned SOC veteran, security researcher, or a cyber security student building skills in a homelab, you're welcome to join us.
